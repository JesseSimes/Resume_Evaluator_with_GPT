## 🔍 **Project Goal**

Build a system that:

* **Parses resumes** (from `.docx`, `.pdf`, etc.)
* Extracts relevant information (skills, education, experience, etc.)
* **Evaluates them** for a given **job role**
* Uses **GPT-based prompt engineering** to provide **feedback**, **scoring**, and **recommendations**

---

## 📘 **Project Coverage Breakdown**

### 🧩 **Phase 1: Planning and Dataset Preparation**

* ✅ Organize 288 `.docx` resumes
* ✅ Tag or classify job role (if available) for each resume
* ✅ Define a few target job roles for evaluation (e.g., Web Developer, Data Analyst, UI/UX Designer)
* ✅ Define criteria for evaluation:

  * Skill match
  * Format
  * ATS friendliness
  * Experience alignment
  * Education relevance

---

### 🧾 **Phase 2: Resume Parsing and Information Extraction**

> 🔧 *Focus: NLP tools and preprocessing*

* Read `.docx` files (using `python-docx`)
* Extract:

  * Name
  * Email/contact
  * Education
  * Skills
  * Experience
  * Certifications/projects
* Use NLP tools like:

  * `spaCy` for Named Entity Recognition
  * Regular expressions for emails, phone numbers, etc.

✅ Outcome: A structured resume JSON like:

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@email.com",
  "skills": ["Python", "Data Analysis", "Pandas"],
  "education": "B.Tech in Computer Science",
  "experience": "2 years in analytics at XYZ",
  ...
}
```

### 💬 **Phase 3: Prompt Engineering & GPT Feedback**

> 🔧 *Focus: OpenAI GPT model prompting and refinement*

* Design GPT prompts to:

  * Evaluate the parsed resume against a given job description
  * Provide structured feedback (strengths, weaknesses, tips)
  * Generate scores (0–100 or star rating)
* Experiment with:

  * Role-specific prompts
  * Chain-of-thought prompting
  * Few-shot examples (optional)

✅ Outcome: Clean and reliable GPT-powered feedback.

---

### 📊 **Phase 4: Scoring Logic & Evaluation**

> 🔧 *Focus: Logic & consistency*

* Define scoring rules:

  * Skill match: 40%
  * Experience relevance: 30%
  * Education alignment: 10%
  * Formatting: 10%
  * Certifications/projects: 10%
* Combine GPT feedback + rule-based components (hybrid logic)
* Optional: Use cosine similarity or embeddings (OpenAI or `sentence-transformers`) to match resume and job description

✅ Outcome: Each resume gets a score and personalized feedback.

---

### 🌐 **Phase 5: Web App (Optional but Ideal)**

> 🔧 *Focus: Integrate everything into a frontend*

* Frontend in **React** or **Streamlit**
* Upload resume ➜ select job role ➜ get feedback instantly
* Show:

  * Parsed summary
  * Feedback
  * Score
  * Downloadable report (PDF)

✅ Outcome: Complete usable application.

---

### 📦 **Phase 6: Export and Reporting**

> 🔧 *Focus: Real-world usability*

* Option to generate:

  * PDF feedback report
  * JSON export of evaluation data
* Batch processing of multiple resumes
